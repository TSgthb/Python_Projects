<p align="justify">
This repository contains a collection of Python projects that demonstrate practical applications of data analytics, automation, and scripting. Each project is designed to showcase end-to-end workflows, from data extraction and transformation to analysis and reporting, along with specialized scripts for predictive modeling and automation.
</p>

The projects span three major categories:

#### 1. Data Analytics Projects

These projects focus on analyzing diverse datasets to uncover actionable insights. They illustrate the complete data analytics pipeline, including:

- **Data Extraction**: Pulling datasets from online sources, such as Kaggle, official websites and so on.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies while standardizing formats for dates, strings, and categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performing descriptive statistics, making visualizations, and doing trend analysis to identify patterns and anomalies.
- **Reporting & Insights**: Summarizing findings into meaningful insights that support decision-making.

#### 2. Web Scraping Projects

These projects demonstrate techniques for extracting structured data from websites using Python libraries such as `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. The workflow typically includes:

- Sending `HTTP` requests and handling responses.
- Parsing `HTML` content into a BeautifulSoup object.
- Extracting relevant information and storing it in CSV files for further analysis.

#### 3. Personal Automation & Predictive Projects

These projects highlight custom scripts developed based on personal and practical use cases:

- **Database Growth Predictor**: Utilizes Linear Regression to forecast database growth for the next six months based on historical backup data. Takes Excel sheet as input. 
- **Conveyance Receipts Generator**: A lightweight script that converts conveyance data from Excel sheets into receipt-like images for easy documentation and record-keeping.
