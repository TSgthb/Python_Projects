# Understanding & Analyzing the Data for App Store and Google Play Marketplaces for Profitable App Profiles.

_**Dev_It!**_, a mobile applications company which develops various apps for the platforms, android and iOS which are free to download and install. Their main source of revenue is from the in-app advertisements, that is, more the users of apps and more the people who see and engange with ads, the better.

Thus, from this project we want to understand, analyze the open-source apps-stores' data and thus make better decisions in terms of what apps are more likely to attract custumers and ultimately, bring in more revenue to the company.
